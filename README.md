First: Package build from spring.io
Then load the project in ide
write pom.xml with related dependency load
Update build.gradle.kts - with specific plugins and dependencies if needed


then write main controller
Write another controller with get request
then error handling issue will come
create a customErrorHandling class to solve that

The getMapping is not working -- Add tomcat dependency in pom.xml / dependencies in build.gradle.kts

Setup ide for autobuild on code update
